    CAUTION - Set the local osd units in the charm to 'out' but does not stop
    the osds.  Unless the osd cluster is set to noout (see below), this removes
    them from the ceph cluster and forces ceph to migrate the PGs to other OSDs
    in the cluster.  See the following.

    http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/add-or-rm-osds/#removing-the-osd
    "Do not let your cluster reach its full ratio when removing an OSD.
    Removing OSDs could cause the cluster to reach or exceed its full ratio."
    Also note that for small clusters you may encounter the corner case where
    some PGs remain stuck in the active+remapped state. Refer to the above link
    on how to resolve this.

    pause-health unit can be used before pausing the ceph units to stop the
    cluster rebalancing the data off this unit.  pause-health sets 'noout' on
    the cluster such that it will not try to rebalance the data accross the
    remaining units.

    It is up to the user of the charm to determine whether pause-health should
    be used as it depends on whether the osd is being paused for maintenance or
    to remove it from the cluster completely.

      description: |
        The pool type which may either be replicated to recover from lost OSDs by keeping multiple copies of the
        objects or erasure to get a kind of generalized RAID5 capability.
    replicas:
      type: integer
      default: 3
      description: |
        For the replicated pool this is the number of replicas to store of each object.

    data-chunks:
      type: integer
      default: 3
      description: |
        The number of data chunks, i.e. the number of chunks in which the original object is divided. For instance
        if K = 2 a 10KB object will be divided into K objects of 5KB each.
    coding-chunks:
      type: integer
      default: 2
      description: |
        The number of coding chunks, i.e. the number of additional chunks computed by the encoding functions.
        If there are 2 coding chunks, it means 2 OSDs can be out without losing data.
    locality-chunks:
      type: integer
      description: |
        Group the coding and data chunks into sets of size locality. For instance, for k=4 and m=2, when locality=3
        two groups of three are created. Each set can be recovered without reading chunks from another set.
    durability-estimator:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The number of parity chunks each of which includes each data chunk in its calculation range. The number is used
        as a durability estimator. For instance, if c=2, 2 OSDs can be down without losing data.
